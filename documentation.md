# Documentation

Easy Top-down Controller 2D can be used with hardly any code written by the user, but its power comes from taking advantage of the API developed with it.  
In this section you can check all the methods and properties of the controller in detail, and learn how to use them.  

The first pages explain the no-code parts of the controller, and should be read to understand how to use the asset.  
On the other hand, the last pages explain how to interact with the asset via code, which is more advanced and requires a bit of knowledge of the underlying code, but is also essential for developing complex games. 

If you want to find something specific, use the search bar at the top of the page.
