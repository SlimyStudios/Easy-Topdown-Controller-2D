# Easy Top-down Controller 2D
Want to create a new top-down project and don't know where to start?  
Find yourself having to write a lot of boilerplate code just to have a square moving in the screen?  

**Easy Top-Down Controller 2D does all the hard work for you, so you can focus on the game itself!**

The asset has been coded to ensure **near-zero runtime GC**, making the **impact on your game's performance negligible**.

It's also built following the **State Machine pattern**, easily allowing you to **add new states and transitions**.

It includes:
- **Free** and **grid** based **movement systems**, with completely customizable parameters, like movement speed or even the size of the grid (allowing arbitrary sized grids).
  
- **Interact**, **Attack**, **Shoot** and **Roll** built-in actions, each of one with its own animations.

- **Shooter rotation**, allowing you to rotate the player to face the mouse cursor or the right stick of a controller.

- Built with the **Unity New Input System**, making it **compatible with any kind of controller** without any extra work.

- **Custom frame-based animation system**, you'll never touch the animator again! 

- All **configuration is saved in Scriptable Objects**, so changing the behavior of the controller mid-game is as easy as assigning another value.  
Want a game where the **gameplay changes between top-down shooter** and a **space shoot'em up**? Then you've come to the right place!

- ...and much more!  
  If you want to **try some examples made with the asset**, check out the [Examples](examples.md) section of the page.
